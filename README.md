# RS-Podcast

Android app for listening to Rolling Stones songs. If you don't know them hahahha it's the best rock n' roll band ever. The podcast includes the entire official albums, and some inedited live shows, like Paris and Bruselas in the 70's.

It runs as a service in the notification area, and requires internet connection, only. ~~You can get the latest apk here: https://github.com/Lucho-A/RS-Podcast/tree/master/app/release~~

Enjoy itttttt!!!

__Nov-2022 Update__: sadly, the url where it was hosted the songs it was closed (I suppose because copyright issues). Anyway, it can be useful for any podcast, so I let the repository just for the code.
